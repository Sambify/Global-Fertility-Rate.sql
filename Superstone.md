This dataset contains the VIIRS 375 m (VNP14IMGTDL_NRT) active fire product, which is the latest product to be added to the NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS). It provides data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite. The 375 m data complements MODIS fire detections; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity.
